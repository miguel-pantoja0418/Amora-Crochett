# Amora-Crochett
Cloud-based application demonstrating AWS backend architecture.

Amora is a cloud-based application created to demonstrate practical AWS backend architecture, cloud integration, and secure data handling.

This project focuses on real-world infrastructure patterns rather than UI polish.

## Architecture Overview
- Cloud Provider: AWS
- Backend: AWS Lambda
- Compute: EC2 (private instances)
- Database: PostgreSQL (AWS)
- Networking: VPC with private subnets and bastion access
- Monitoring: CloudWatch
- Infrastructure Pattern: Bastion host + IAM-based access

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Practical AWS usage (not theoretical)
- Secure access to private resources
- Backend-first architecture
- Experience with EC2, Lambda, networking, and databases
- Operational understanding of cloud environments

## Current Status
This repository is in an initial documentation phase.
The infrastructure and services already exist in an AWS account and are being documented and prepared for code and infrastructure-as-code representation.

## Notes
This project is intended for technical review and architectural evaluation purposes.
